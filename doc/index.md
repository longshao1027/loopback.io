## New LoopBack documentation site

This is the official documentation site for LoopBack. The [previous documentation site](http://docs.strongloop.com) is deprecated.

Content on this site is sourced in [GitHub](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/blob/gh-pages/pages/) to enable the open-source community to contribute.
For more information, see [Contributing to LoopBack documentation](en/contrib/).

For a complete list of planned and in-progress tasks, see [tasks in the loopback.io GitHub repo](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/issues).

This site is based on Tom Johnson's [Documentation Jekyll theme](https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/documentation-theme-jekyll).
